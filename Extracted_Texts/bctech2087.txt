It gives similarity between words so we can easily find related words.We used the allennlp library and created bar charts and heatmaps to show higher and lower attention words. It means when it finds question related words in the context it gives higher value to those words and if words are not related it gives lower values.We used a gradient based method to show higher and lower gradient values word according to question text and created bar charts and text color charts to show higher gradient values.Project DeliverablesA notebook which has an explanation of the bert question answering model using some visualization.Tools usedGoogle colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Bertviz, Allennlp, TransformersLanguage/techniques usedPython programming language, Deep learning, NLP, Data VisualizationModels usedPretrained bert-base-uncased model and distilbert model (both trained on squad2 dataset)Skills usedData visualization, Deep learning, NLP, pythonWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionWe need to use the best pre-trained model which can give good results on different questions and answers.We were working on text data so we need to use charts which can clearly show differences between higher attention and lower attention value words.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedFor best pretrained we tried different Bert’s pretrained models like distilbert(trained on squad dataset), distilbert(trained on squad2), bert base uncased, bert large and roberta base.Among these models we kept the best one.For solving charts related issues we used heatmap chart, bar chart with dark and light colors and text coloring method.Project SnapshotsPrevious articleDesign and develop solution to anomaly detection classification problemsNext articleMedical ClassificationAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSGangala.in: E-commerce Big Data ETL / ELT Solution and Data WarehouseJanuary 16, 2022Website Tracking and Insights using Google Analytics, & Google Tag ManagerJuly 1, 2022How machine learning used in finance and banking?May 27, 2021Database Discovery Tool using OpenAIJanuary 20, 2024Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSHow machine learning will affect your business?Car Detection in Satellite ImagesMarketing, sales, and financial data business dashboard (Wink Report)An agent-based model of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP)
