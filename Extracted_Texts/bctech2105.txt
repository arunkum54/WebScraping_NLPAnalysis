We can then pay you weekly to keep them up to date. You can choose any technology you like, as long as it’s updated into an SQL database. Additional tasks may be to make an alert or dashboard from data, later access API when it becomes available.Our SolutionWe provided a robust solution which returned the NFT data every 8 hours into the google big query database. To do this we used selenium web driver to scrape all events as the website was dynamic and did not have a format data structure to scrape data using AJAX POST calls. After automating the scarper the data was manipulated and constructed into a desired format into pandas dataframe, which was later used to push the dataframe into the google big query database using Google cloud api and credentials. The data was getting collected every day and about 50M distinct rows were created.Project DeliverablesWebcrawler and databaseTools usedPythonSeleniumGBQLanguage/techniques usedPythonSelenium web scraperPandasGoogle big queryParallel processing.Databases usedSQLGoogle BigQueryWeb Cloud Servers usedGoogle BigQueryWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe only technical challenge faced during this project was that the website used to keep changing the elements on their webpage and used to cause error.
