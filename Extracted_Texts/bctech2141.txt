The Scrapy library has been used to crawl and scrape. Beautiful soup could have also been used for the scraping purpose, but for the sake of consistency, Scrapy has been used for both purposes.Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.Even though Scrapy was originally designed forweb scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such asAmazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler.Four Spiders have been created for each category to be scraped. Every spider crawls all the states in Germany and scrapes all the apartment listings for important data. Every spider creates a separate JSON file to store all its data. This data is then converted to CSV using another python script called “conversion”.The python tool has been completely automated and only needs the “Controller” script to be run. The script also has the capability of running every two weeks automatically.Project DeliverablesFour CSV files (one for each category):Mieten Wohnungen.csvKaufen Wohnungen.csvKaufen Anlageobjekte.csvKaufen Grundstuck.csvLanguage/techniques usedPythonWeb Crawling & ScrapingSkills usedData ScrapingData CrawlingAdvanced Python programmingProject SnapshotsPrevious articleTraction Dashboards of Marketing Campaigns and PostsNext articleDatawarehouse, and Recommendations Engine for AirBNBAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSImpact of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) on the Indian EconomyApril 11, 2020Marketing Analytics – Why do we care about it?April 30, 2019Will AI Replace Us or Work With Us?June 25, 2021SurveyMonkey Business Questioner Report using Power BIJune 26, 2021Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTS7up7down, 10upDown, Snakes and Ladder Games built using OOPsWhat Analytics & IT Outsourcing engagement model is right for you?Steps to Convert a Node.js API to Python for AWS Lambda...Integrating and Deriving Insights from the Cost of Equity
