HomeOur Success StoriesAWS Lex Voice and ChatbotOur Success StoriesITLifestyle, eCommerce & Online Market PlaceAWS Lex Voice and ChatbotByAjay Bidyarthy-January 29, 20222808Client BackgroundClient:A leading tech firm in USAIndustry Type:ITServices:eCommerceOrganization Size:40+Project ObjectiveCreate a Voice and chatbot using AWS lex which can book flights, hotels, cars and book some fun activities in a city.Project DescriptionWe need to create a voice and chatbot using AWS lex and lambda function. The bot should book a flight, a hotel, and a car by asking some relevant questions to the user like destination, origin, date, etc. We also need to create a combination of all these which can plan the whole trip, flight, hotel, car and book some fun activities.Our SolutionWe have created aws lex intents and lambda functions for all bookings. Intents manage front ends like utterances (user can ask to the bot) and slots (bot replies with relevant questions). Lambda functions manage backend parts like which intent should be triggered if the user says “ book a flight” or “book a hotel” or “book a car”. For search results we have used some external APIs like Amadeus for flight, sabre for hotels and blablacar for car booking.  We have modified search results by using Data Analytics (for getting the cheapest and good star flight and hotel), Machine learning (for getting user’s preferences by analyzing user’s history) and NLP (Differentiate search results by text analysis) techniques so users can get the best search results.Project DeliverablesAn aws lex voice and chatbot which can book flight, hotel, car and fun activities. This can be integrated with IOS applications.Tools usedAWS Lex, AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, AWS EC2, Google colab, VS code, FAST API, Uvicorn.Language/techniques usedpython, machine learning, data analytics, NLP.Models usedTfIdf-Vectorizer and cosine similaritySkills usedData Analytics, Machine learning, NLP, Python, AWS, REST APIs.Databases usedMySQLWeb Cloud Servers usedAWSWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe first challenge we have faced is the integration of AWS lex and lambda functions.Amadeus and Sabre APIs data was not in a good format so we have to clean some data and organize it in a usable format.We need to make some APIs so we can pass flight or hotel parameters and the APIs will give flight or hotel related data.Create a book button in the bot for booking flights, hotel,s and car.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedSo the integration of AWS lex and lambda function was very tough for us. Because lex uses some intentes to show responses from the lambda function. So we have created different lex intents to pass messages to lex bot from lambda function. And put some good coding to the lambda function so different messages can be handled by different intents.For flight, hotel and car search results we were using some external apis like amadeus, sabre and blablacars apis. These APIs have a lot of data and are not in a format we need.  So first we cleaned data and then sorted data according to cheaper and best ratings results. We have used the best two results among all the results.We cannot use all the machine learning and data analytics part in aws lambda function. So what we did was we created some REST APIs which can handle all the data analytics and machine learning part and we hosted these APIs on AWS EC2 instance. We used these APIs in our lambda functions.So Creating a button in a chat bot or voice bot is always so different from providing text messages. For creating a button we used a response card structure in lambda function which can handle button and button related responses.Project SnapshotsProject VideoPrevious articleMetaBridges API Decentraland Integration – AR, VRNext articleAI/ML and Predictive ModelingAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSAnalyze Fraudulent Call Data with Stream Analytics and Visualize Results in...March 16, 2021Data Warehouse to Google Data Studio (Looker) DashboardJuly 29, 2023Building a Physics-Informed Neural Network for Circuit EvaluationJuly 21, 2023Algorithmic trading for multiple commodities markets, like Forex, Metals, Energy, etc.December 31, 2022Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSAutomated Campaign Management System: A Comprehensive Solution with LinkedIn and Email...ML and AI-based insurance premium model to predict premium to be...Prediction Model for Online CasinoWhy scams like Nirav Modi Happen with Indian banks?
